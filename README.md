# Advent Of Code
Advent Of Code is an advent calendar for coding puzzles! Every day from the 1st of december a puzzle containing two parts is published and it's up to the programmers to solve them! 

This repository contains the solutions that I created to solve the puzzles. They are not perfect, but they do the job :)

## Year 2024
During my internship in the Tech & Data department of Jumbo, a colleague of mine has created an Advent Of Code private leaderboard for all of the SAP Supply Chain Management teams. Let's see how this will go!

### Structuring
Within the folder "/2024" you can find a folder for the solution(s) of each day. There is one application per day that contains the solutions for both part 1 and 2 in some way or another.
